# clicker-game-project
We are developing an 2D incremental clicker game using godot. This is a personal project that we are using to get our hands into game development.

# *Samurai Clicker*
Currently this is the placeholder name for the project, this is subject to change as well as the story and setting for the game. 

The name, setting and characters are not finalized until we are comfortable with the prototype of the game.

# Background
The game set in a fantasy world inspired by Japanese folklore and history. Its gameplay is strongly based on clicking and upgrading items and the character to get more points. Influences include *Cookie Clicker* and *Sakura Clicker.*

# Theme and Setting
Samurai Clicker is a 2D incremental clicker game set inÂ a historical fantasy version of Japan. The player takes on the role of the Samurai and gets to fight yokai and collect resources to become stronger. While the setting of the game takes place in Japan, there will be fantasized elements as well as supernatural elements across game world.

# Budget

We plan to work on this project on our own time and are currently not looking into investing any of our money. We are also currently not looking for investors since this will be our first project.

# Project Timeline

The overall timeline of the project is still unknown due to life. But we will be working one bits and pieces from the major processes below in **bold**.

We intend to use the Godot game engine for our project. Primarily using GDScript since we as a team want to learn the langauge and become more familiar with what the game engine has to offer.

The project will primarily be in 2D and the art will be pixel based. 

There is currently no plans on music or sound, since we are currently working on developing a minimum marketable product. We want to get the basics down before we attempt to add anything to the overall aesthetics of the game.

**Story and Design**

>We plan to initially work on developing the small story, but since it is an incremental game there is a possibility the story will be nonexistent. 
>
>We plan to also work on designing the items, characters, worlds/realms, and enemies.

**Development**

>We will begin development once we have around at least 2 to 3 worlds designed and created. We will also have around 5-10 items/upgrades per each world. 
>
>Depending on how advanced we make the items and the upgrades the development might start sooner or later.

**Testing**

>Once we have a world/realm developed we will test the gameplay. Once we feel the initial world/realm is to our liking we will develop the next world.
